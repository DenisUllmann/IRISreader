irisreader documentation
======================================

The IRISreader library provides functionality to read level 2 data from the
`IRIS satellite <https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/iris/index.html>`_ 
and to preprocess it for big data applications. 

The following structure contains a quickstart tutorial and a reference
library of the irisreader interface. IRISreader also involves a lot of 
functionality that is hidden from the end user, these classes and methods have
not been documented yet and are not intended for use by non-developers.
